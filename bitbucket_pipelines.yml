# This is an example pipeline configuration for Veracode SAST and Agent Based Scan SCA
# Requires environment variables to be set: 
# VERACODE_ID - Veracode API ID, see https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_create_api_creds
# VERACODE_KEY - Veracode API Key, see https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_create_api_creds
# SRCCLR_API_TOKEN - activation token for SCA Agent, see https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_sc_bitbucket_token

# - Results will be output into the console output as well as uploaded to the Veracode Platform.

# - First we are downloading the latest Pipeline Scanner, and extracting and running it.
# - Next, we have are calling our API Credentials, pointing the scanner at the artifact we wish to scan, and then have our failure parameters in place.
# - If you wish to utilize Baseline File, you would add that as another line to point that at your baseline.json file which would sit in this repository.
# - For our Pipeline Scan, we have set our allow_failure to FALSE by default.
# - This is in order to break the build if we find flaws that violate our failure parameters.
# - Results will be output into the console output.
